My hobby is Lord of the Rings

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:10.800
Strategy panel game, and it's a board game
where you have miniatures

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.333
of the characters of Lord the Rings
and you can recreate battles

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.766
from the movie and the book, of course,
but you also need to paint them

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:24.733
painting process

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:28.233
It starts with the base color, of course,
and then you can stylize

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.366
your own miniatures however you want.

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:34.366
Mostly I style my miniatures
as correctly as the book describes.

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.900
The time I work on the one

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.700
miniature really depends on
how good of a quality I want.

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:43.100
I can spend like a few hours
on a whole army

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.733
or I can spend like 18 hours
to 20 hours on one hero.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.666
It's all about quality you want to acheive.
